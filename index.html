    <pr>
        My name is Amanul Haque, and I have recently enrolled in Amity University, Noida for a course in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in Data Science. Although classes have not commenced yet, I am eagerly awaiting the start of my academic journey. I completed my 10th grade from Kharagpur Visison Academy School, where I achieved a remarkable 82% score. Following that, I completed my 12th grade from St. Jude's Public School with a 70% score. Currently, I am engrossed in learning programming languages such as C and C++, as well as Data Structures and Algorithms. As for my professional endeavors, this is my inaugural project involving HTML and CSS.

    "About this Website"
</h3>
<div id="content1">
   <pr> <b><br>I am excited to share my first-ever computer science project, which also serves as my portfolio website. This project allowed me to apply my skills in HTML and CSS to create a personalized and interactive website that showcases my work and achievements. Over the course of six days, I dedicated my time and effort to complete this project, and I am proud to present the final result.</b>
        <br><br><br>
        <b><i><u><h4>Project Details:</h4></u></i></b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><i>1. <u>First Step into Computer Science:</u></i></b>
        Embarking on this project marked my initial foray into the field of computer science. It provided me with the opportunity to dive into web development and gain hands-on experience in building websites. This project holds a special place in my journey as it represents my early exploration and enthusiasm for computer science.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><i>2. <u>Portfolio Website:</u></i></b>
        The primary objective of this project was to create a portfolio website. A portfolio website acts as a virtual resume or an online showcase of an individual's skills, projects, and achievements. By designing and developing this website, I aimed to present my abilities and accomplishments in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><i>3. <u>Utilizing HTML and CSS:</u></i></b>
        To bring my portfolio website to life, I utilized HTML and CSS. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) enabled me to structure the content of the webpages, defining headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allowed me to customize the visual appearance of the website, including colors, fonts, layouts, and animations. By combining these two languages, I was able to create a cohesive and engaging user experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><i>4. <u>Completion Timeline:</u></i></b>
        The project spanned over a period of six days. Throughout this time, I dedicated myself to planning, designing, coding, and refining the website. Each day, I worked diligently to make progress, ensuring that I met my desired objectives and deadlines. This timeline allowed me to learn valuable time management skills and maintain a consistent workflow.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><i>5. <u>The Final Product:</u></i></b>
        After investing my time and effort into this project, I successfully developed a fully functional portfolio website. This website serves as a comprehensive representation of my skills, projects, and achievements. I ensured that the website was aesthetically pleasing, easy to navigate, and accessible across different devices. By creating this website, I now have a digital platform where I can share my work with others, potential employers, or collaborators.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><i>6. <u>Conclusion:</u></i></b>
    My first computer science project, a portfolio website built using HTML and CSS, has been an exciting and rewarding experience. It has provided me with invaluable knowledge in web development and has given me a chance to display my skills to the world. This project has also helped me establish a solid foundation in computer science and will serve as a stepping stone for future projects and endeavors. I am proud of my achievement and look forward to continuing my growth in the field of computer science.</pr>
