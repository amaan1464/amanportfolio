        My name is Amanul Haque, and I have recently enrolled in Amity University, Noida for a course in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in Data Science. Although classes have not commenced yet, I am eagerly awaiting the start of my academic journey. I completed my 10th grade from Kharagpur Visison Academy School, where I achieved a remarkable 82% score. Following that, I completed my 12th grade from St. Jude's Public School with a 70% score. Currently, I am engrossed in learning programming languages such as C and C++, as well as Data Structures and Algorithms. As for my professional endeavors, this is my inaugural project involving HTML and CSS.
